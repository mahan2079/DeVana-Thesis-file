# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Imagine you have a function that does something with the DEAP library (which is used for evolutionary algorithms).
# Sometimes, DEAP can get into a weird state (for example, if you try to register the same class twice), and your function might crash.
# This helper function is a "decorator" – a special kind of function in Python that wraps around another function to add extra behavior.
# In this case, the decorator tries to run your function, and if it fails, it will try up to 3 times.
# If it fails, it also tries to "clean up" DEAP's global state by deleting certain attributes, so the next attempt has a better chance of working.
# If it still fails after 3 tries, it gives up and raises the error.

# The science/logic behind this:
# - DEAP uses global state to register things like "FitnessMin" and "Individual" classes.
# - If you try to register them again, or if something goes wrong, DEAP can throw errors.
# - By deleting these attributes, you can "reset" DEAP's state and try again.
# - The retry loop is a common pattern for handling flaky or stateful errors.

    Python concepts used here:
    - Decorators: Functions that modify the behavior of other functions.
    - Nested functions: Defining a function (wrapper) inside another function.
    - Exception handling: Using try/except to catch and handle errors.

        # (No explicit return here; if all retries fail, the exception is raised)

    # Return the wrapper function so it can be used as a decorator
    return wrapper

# Python concepts to understand here:
# - Decorators: Used to add retry/error-handling logic to any function that might have DEAP issues.
# - Exception handling: try/except blocks let you catch and respond to errors.
# - Attribute manipulation: 
#   - The functions hasattr() and delattr() are used here to interact with Python objects at runtime.
#   - hasattr(object, name) checks if the given object has an attribute with the specified name, returning True or False.
#   - delattr(object, name) removes the specified attribute from the object if it exists.
#   - In this context, we use these functions to check if DEAP's global 'creator' object has certain classes (like 'FitnessMin' or 'Individual') registered as attributes, and if so, remove them to clean up the global state before retrying the operation.
# - Loops: The for loop is used to retry the operation multiple times.

# Suggestions for improvement:
# 1. You could make the list of attributes to clean up configurable, in case you want to handle other DEAP classes.
# 2. Instead of printing errors, you could use Python's logging module for better control over error reporting.
# 3. You could add a small delay (e.g., time.sleep(0.1)) between retries to avoid hammering the system if something is wrong.

    """Background worker thread that executes the Genetic Algorithm (GA).

    generation_metrics = pyqtSignal(dict)

    # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # Python Concepts to Understand Here:
    # - Classes and Inheritance: GAWorker is a class that inherits from QThread,
    #   which means it gets all the threading capabilities of QThread.
    # - PyQt Signals: These are special variables that allow communication between
    #   threads in PyQt applications. They are declared as class variables using
    #   pyqtSignal.
    # - Thread Safety: Signals ensure that data passed between threads is handled
    #   safely, preventing crashes or data corruption.
    #
    # ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    # Overall Purpose:
    # This __init__ method initializes a GAWorker object, configuring all parameters needed to run a genetic algorithm (GA) optimization.
    # It supports advanced features such as adaptive rates, machine learning (ML) and reinforcement learning (RL) controllers, surrogate models, and neural network-based seeding.
    #
    # Underlying Python Concepts:
    # - This is a class constructor (__init__), which is a special method in Python that is automatically called when a new instance of the class is created. It is used to initialize the object's attributes and set up any necessary state.
    # - The __init__ method can take both required and optional arguments. Required arguments must be provided by the caller, while optional arguments have default values and can be omitted.
    # - Default arguments (e.g., alpha=0.01) allow the user to create a GAWorker object with minimal parameters for simple use cases, or to override defaults for advanced customization. This makes the class flexible and user-friendly.
    # - The method signature shows how Python supports both positional and keyword arguments. Positional arguments (like main_params) must be given in order, while keyword arguments (like alpha=0.01) can be specified by name, improving code readability.
    # - The use of keyword arguments and default values also makes the API more robust to future changes, as new optional parameters can be added without breaking existing code that uses the class.
    # - This design pattern is common in Python for classes that may have many configuration options, as it balances ease of use with extensibility.
    # - The docstring and comments within the method provide documentation, helping users and developers understand what each parameter does and how to use the class effectively.
    #
    # Key Python Principles:
    # - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): This is a method of a class, encapsulating state and behavior.
    # - Function Arguments: Shows positional, keyword, and default arguments.
    # - Documentation: Docstrings and comments clarify usage and intent.

        # Genetic Algorithm Worker Initialization

        # worker class. The GA worker is responsible for optimizing a set of
        # parameters to achieve specified target objectives, using evolutionary
        # strategies such as selection, crossover, and mutation.
        #
        # The constructor accepts a comprehensive set of parameters that define:
        #   - The system to be optimized (main_params, ga_parameter_data)
        #   - The optimization objectives and their relative importance (target_values_dict, weights_dict)
        #   - The search/analysis space (omega_start, omega_end, omega_points)
        #   - Genetic algorithm configuration (population size, generations, rates, tolerance)
        #   - Optional adaptive and tracking features
        #
        # Underlying Python Concepts:

        - This constructor sets up all configuration for the GA worker.
        - Parameters are stored as instance attributes for use throughout the optimization process.
        - Adaptive rates allow the GA to dynamically balance exploration and exploitation.
        - The design leverages Python's object-oriented features for maintainability and extensibility.

        # The concept of 'self' in Python is fundamental to understanding how classes and objects work.
        # 'self' is a reference to the current instance of the class. It allows each object created from a class
        # to keep track of its own data. When you define a method inside a class, the first parameter is always 'self',
        # which means "the object that is calling this method."
        #
        # For example, if you have:
        #   class Dog:
        #       def bark(self):
        #           print("Woof!")
        #   my_dog = Dog()
        #   my_dog.bark()
        # Here, inside the 'bark' method, 'self' refers to 'my_dog'.
        #
        # Why do we need 'self'? Because each object (instance) of a class can have its own data.
        # For example:
        #   class Dog:
        #       def __init__(self, name):
        #           self.name = name
        #   dog1 = Dog("Fido")
        #   dog2 = Dog("Rex")
        #   print(dog1)        # prints something like "<__main__.Dog object at 0x7f8b2c3e0>"
        #   print(dog1.name)   # prints "Fido"
        #   print(dog2.name)   # prints "Rex"
        # By default, printing an object like 'dog1' shows its type and memory address,
        # unless the class defines a __str__ or __repr__ method for a custom string representation.
        # Here, 'self.name' means "the name belonging to this particular dog."
        #
        # In summary:
        # - 'self' is how an object refers to itself.
        # - It lets each object keep track of its own data and methods.
        # - When you see 'self.x', it means "the x that belongs to this object."
        # - You must always include 'self' as the first parameter in instance methods.

        # --- Plain English Explanation ---
        # This block sets up a watchdog timer using Qt's QTimer class. The timer is configured to fire only once
        # (single-shot) and, when triggered, will call the 'handle_timeout' method. This mechanism is used to
        # automatically handle situations where the program runs too long without progress, acting as a safety net.
        # The 'last_progress_update' variable tracks the last time progress was made, which can be used to reset
        # or check the timer as needed.

        # --- Python Concepts ---
        # - QTimer is a Qt class for event-driven programming, allowing you to schedule code execution after a delay.
        # - The 'setSingleShot' method ensures the timer only triggers once per start.
        # - The 'timeout.connect' method uses Qt's signal-slot mechanism to bind the timer's event to a handler.
        # - Instance variables (self.*) are used to maintain state within the class.

        # --- Production-Quality Comments and Code ---
        self.watchdog_timer = QTimer()  # Instantiate a QTimer for monitoring long-running operations
        self.watchdog_timer.setSingleShot(True)  # Configure timer to trigger only once per activation
        self.watchdog_timer.timeout.connect(self.handle_timeout)  # Connect timer expiration to timeout handler
        self.last_progress_update = 0  # Timestamp or counter for the last recorded progress update

        # --- Python Principles Highlighted ---
        # - Object-oriented programming: using instance variables and methods within a class.
        # - Event-driven programming: leveraging Qt's signal-slot system for asynchronous event handling.

        # --- Suggestions for Learning ---
        # 1. Try making the watchdog timer interval configurable via a class parameter, so you can experiment with different timeout durations.
        # 2. Add logging inside 'handle_timeout' to record when and why the timeout occurs, helping you learn about debugging and monitoring long-running processes.

            # ============================================================================
            # This section initializes the first generation of candidate solutions for the genetic algorithm (GA).
            # The seeding method (random, Sobol, or Latin Hypercube Sampling) determines how the initial population is distributed in parameter space.
            # The code uses a helper function to lazily initialize a Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) engine for low-discrepancy sampling if required.

            # --- Plain English Explanation ---
            # The code emits a message to indicate that the population initialization is starting.
            # It defines a helper function to set up a QMC engine (for Sobol or LHS seeding) only when needed.
            # The QMC engine is used to generate well-distributed initial samples in the parameter space, improving the diversity of the initial population.
            # If the QMC engine cannot be initialized (e.g., due to an error or unsupported method), the code falls back to random seeding.

            # --- Python Concepts and Science ---
            # - Uses function definition for modularity and lazy initialization (function is only called if needed).
            # - Uses exception handling (try/except) to ensure robustness and fallback behavior.
            # - Uses object attributes (self._qmc_engine) to store state across function calls.
            # - Applies conditional logic (if/elif/else) to select the appropriate seeding method.
            # - Utilizes external libraries (e.g., scipy.stats.qmc) for advanced sampling techniques.

            # --- How Population Changes After Each Generation ---
            # After the initial population is created, the genetic algorithm evolves the population over generations.
            # In each generation, individuals are selected, mated, and mutated to produce new candidate solutions.
            # The population thus gradually shifts toward regions of the parameter space with better fitness, guided by the evaluation function and genetic operators.

            # --- Plain English Explanation ---
            # This block initializes the population for the genetic algorithm (GA), using either a neural network-based seeder
            # or a classical seeding method (random, Sobol, or LHS). If neural seeding is enabled, it prepares the neural seeder
            # with parameter bounds and fixed values, then emits a message about the chosen method. The initial population is generated,
            # evaluated, and, if neural seeding is used, the results are fed back to the neural seeder for future use. Metrics and
            # history are updated for tracking and visualization.

            # --- Python Concepts and Science ---
            # - Conditional logic (if/else) is used to select the seeding strategy.
            # - Numpy arrays are used for efficient numerical operations on parameter bounds.
            # - Loops and array indexing set up masks and values for fixed/variable parameters.
            # - Object instantiation (NeuralSeeder) demonstrates OOP principles.
            # - The population is generated via a helper function, and fitness is evaluated using map and a toolbox function.
            # - Data is collected and stored for metrics and history, supporting reproducibility and analysis.
            # - Exception handling ensures robustness if neural seeder data feeding fails.

            # --- Rewritten with Professional Comments ---

            # Decide which seeding strategy to use for the initial population.
            # The code chooses the neural seeder if self.use_neural_seeding is True.
            # This is set during initialization based on the seeding_method argument or use_neural_seeding flag.
            # If neural seeding is not enabled, it falls back to the method specified by self.seeding_method
            # (which can be "random", "sobol", or "lhs").
            #
            # The logic is:
            # - If self.use_neural_seeding is True, use the neural seeder.
            # - Else, use the classical seeding method as specified.
            #
            # This is determined by the following lines in __init__:
