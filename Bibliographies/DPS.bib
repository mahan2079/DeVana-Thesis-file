  abstract = {The article presents the process of identifying discrete-continuous models with 
  the use of heuristic algorithms. A stepped cantilever beam was used as an example of a 
  discrete-continuous model. The theoretical model was developed based on the formalism of 
  Lagrange multipliers and the Timoshenko theory. Based on experimental research, the 
  theoretical model was validated and the optimization problem was formulated. Optimizations 
  were made for two algorithms: genetic (GA) and particle swarm (PSO). The minimization of

  objective function. The performed process of identifying the theoretical model can be used 
  to determine the eigenfrequencies of models without the need to conduct experimental tests. 
  The presented methodology regarding the parameter identification of the beams with the 
  variable cross-sectional area (according to the Timosheno theory) with additional discrete 
  components allows us to solve similar problems without the need to exit complex patterns.},

  (DVA) are classical optimization problems, which have been already solved for a special 
  case when the primary system has no damping. However, for the general case including a 
  damped primary system, no one has solved these problems by algebraic approaches. Only the 
  numerical solutions have been proposed until now. This paper presents the analytical 
  solutions for the H` and H2 optimization of the DVA attached to the damped primary systems. 
  In the H` optimization the DVA is designed such that the maximum amplitude magnification 
  factor of the primary system is minimized; whereas in the H2 optimization the DVA is 
  designed such that the squared area under the response curve of the primary system is 
  minimized. We found a series solution for the H` optimization and a closed-form algebraic 
  solution for the H2 optimization. The series solution is then compared with the numerical 
  solution in order to check the accuracy in connection with the truncation error of the 
  series. The exact solution presented in this paper is too complicated to handle by a 
  hand-held calculator, so we proposed an approximate solution for the practical object.},

  author = {Ning Su, Jing Bian, Shitao Peng, Zhaoqing Chen, Yi Xia},
  year = {2023},
  abstract = {Negative stiffness (NS) is effective to enhance the control performance of 
  dynamic vibration absorbers (DVAs) on dynamic excitations. Traditional optimal design of 
  NS-DVAs is based on an extension of fixed-point approach, which equalizes the triple fixed 
  points of the dynamic amplification function (DAF) to achieve approximate analytical H∞ 
  optimization for dynamic reduction. However, this leads to an amplification of DAF around 
  the zero frequency, resulting in a significant static amplification effect. For vibration 
  control of purely dynamically excited structures, such as earthquake, the static 
  amplification is neglected. However, for vibrations excited combining static and dynamic 
  components (particularly, wind load), the static amplification may lead to adverse control 
  effect, or even magnify the peak response. In order to avoid this disadvantage, an 
  analytical optimal design approach for inerter-based vibration absorbers (IVAs) with NS 
  (NS-IVAs) is proposed for balancing the static amplification and dynamic reduction effects. 
  Firstly, the parameters of NS-IVAs with respect to the negative stiffness are analytically 
  obtained with fixed-point approach. Subsequently, the characteristics of static 
  amplification and dynamic reduction factors are analyzed. Combining the two factors 
  weighted by the dynamic-static proportion, the control performance factor on the peak 
  response is defined and optimized. Consequently, based on parametric studies, the 
  relationship between the negative stiffness parameter and dynamic-static proportion is 
  empirically formulated for practical application. Finally, the effectiveness of the 
  proposed approach is illustrated based on the numerical example for wind-induced vibration 
  control. The results have shown that the proposed approach is particularly effective for 
  the excitations dynamically characterized by low frequency and mixed with static 
  components.},

  passive bio-inspired limb-like structure (LLS) or X-shaped structure is studied in this 
  paper with theoretical modelling and experimental validation. It is revealed that, (1) the 
  linear horizontally-placed damper and joint friction can both produce equivalent nonlinear 
  damping in the vertical direction; (2) the equivalent damping characteristic is shown to be 
  a nonlinear function of the vibration displacement and varies at different frequency; (3) 
  the equivalent damping can be beneficially varying with vibration displacement and 
  frequencies, i.e., automatically high at around resonance frequency (for large-displacement 
  vibration) but low at other frequencies (for low-displacement vibration), showing an ideal 
  passive and nonlinear damping property; (4) the structural rod length, asymmetric rod 
  length ratio, layer number, and assembly angle can all affect the equivalent nonlinear

  Optimal design, placement and sizing of FVDs have﻿ been extensively﻿ investigated in﻿ the last

  tuned mass damper and nonlinear energy sink under multiple operating conditions},
  author = {Kai Ma, Jingtao Du, Yang Liu, Ximing Chen},
  year = {2024},
  abstract = {In recent years, nonlinear energy sink (NES), as a nonlinear dynamic vibration 
  absorber (NDVA), has been widely studied due to its high robustness and broadband vibration 
  attenuation effectiveness, compared with the traditional linear dynamic vibration absorber 
  (LDVA). In the area of crankshaft torsional vibration reduction, the external excitation of 
  a closed-loop crankshaft model changes with the variation of speed, which puts forward 
  higher requirements for wide-band torsional vibration attenuation. This study attempts to 
  explore the feasibility of NES replacing the traditional linear tuned mass damper (TMD) for 
  engine crankshafts in possible practical engineering application by studying a 
  four-cylinders diesel engine crankshaft. Firstly, a multi-inertias nonlinear closed-loop 
  self-excited coupled oscillation model (M-NCSCO) of crankshaft is established, and the 
  correctness of the model is verified through comparison with those from experiments. Based 
  on this, the crankshaft is coupled with optimal TMD (O-TMD), general NES (G-NES), and 
  optimal NES (O-NES), respectively. An improved Newmark–β method is proposed to solve the 
  nonlinear dynamic model numerically. The effects of NES and TMD on the vibration 
  attenuation behavior of the crankshaft are studied under different engine operating 
  conditions (including power, injection timing, single cylinder flameout, and load). The 
  results show that the vibration attenuation efficiency and robustness of G-NES are 7.90% 
  and 3.47% higher than that of O-TMD when considering the above four typical working 
  conditions comprehensively. After further optimization of G-NES, the vibration reduction 
  efficiency of O-NES is improved by 3.1% compared with G-NES.},

  stiffness structure is unstable and difficult to achieve in engineering practice, and its 
  major drawback is that it amplifies the vibration response of the primary system at low

  the first time the control effect of the inerter device and grounded positive stiffness

  undamped primary system under excitation. First, the dynamic equation of motion of the 
  system is written according to Newton’s second law. Then, the steady-state displacement 
  response of the primary system under harmonic excitation is calculated. In order to 
  minimize the resonant response of the primary system around its natural frequency, the 
  extended fixed point theory is applied. Thus, the optimized parameters such as the tuning 
  frequency ratio, the stiffness ratio, and the approximate damping ratio are determined as a 
  function of mass ratio and inerter–mass ratio. From the results analysis, it was found that 
  the inerter–mass ratio has a better working range to guarantee the stability of the coupled 
  system. Then, study on the effect of inerter–mass ratio on the primary system response is 
  carried out. It can be seen that increasing the inerter–mass ratio in the optimal working 
  range can reduce the response of the primary system beyond its uncontrolled static 
  response. However, it is necessary to avoid the situation where the inerter–mass ratio is 
  very large because it can lead to unrealistic optimal parameters. Finally, comparison with 
  other DVA models is shown under harmonic and random excitation of the primary system. It is 
  found that the proposed DVA model in this paper has high control performance and can be 
  used in many engineering practices.},

  title = {Hybrid Analytical Optimal Approach and Comparative Analyses for Tuned Viscous Mass 
  Damper with Negative Stiffness (TVMDNS)},
  author = {Ruoyu Zhang, Jizhong Huang},
  year = {2024},
  abstract = {Purpose
Tuned viscous mass damper with negative stiffness (TVMDNS) has higher damping efficiency and 
broadband characteristics for vibration control by utilizing dual benefits of the inerter and 
negative stiffness. And single-performance H∞ or H2 optimal methods are adopted to determine 
the optimal parameters of TVMDNS individually. However, the vibration mitigation performance 
of the TVMDNS under high-frequency or resonance excitation based on H∞ optimization is lesser 
than H2 optimization, and quasi-static or low-frequency displacement response based on H2 
optimization will be greater than H∞ optimization. An analytical strategy considering a 
dual-performance of H∞ and H2 norms is lacking at present.
Methods
For this reason, closed-form expressions are derived for the control of structural 
displacement responses based on hybrid H2/H∞ optimal approach. The vibration mitigation 
performance of the TVMDNS is evaluated considering harmonic, stochastic, and impulsive 
excitation using different optimal methods.
Results
The initial static responses and ultra-low-frequency in hybrid H2/H∞ optimal methods are 
between H2 and H∞ optimal design, and the high-frequency and resonance dynamic responses are 
also between those, which indicates an excellent and balanced control performance combining 
the advantages of H2 and H∞ solutions. And the global vibration control can be achieved by 
this dual-performance-based optimal strategy.
Conclusion
When designing the specific TVMDNS, hybrid H2/H∞ optimal design can be considered as the best 
choice for its compatibility and high adaptability for complex stochastic excitation. 
Furthermore, this approach can be extended for various topology connection forms of inerter 
and negative stiffness system for energy dissipation or vibration control.},

  abstract = {The stability of a soft-cored spinning viscoelastic sandwich beam and carbon 
  nanotubes (CNTs) reinforced metal matrix nanocomposites (MMNCs) skin subjected to residual 
  stress have been investigated. The metal matrix nanocomposites (MMNCs) skins are 
  symmetrical and isotropic. In addition, these skins reinforced with uniform and 
  functionally graded (FG) distributions of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are considered. The 
  soft-core of the sandwich beam is deemed to be elastomeric and has internal damping of 
  viscoelastic type. The skin layers of the sandwich beam are subject to residual stresses 
  caused by the production process. Also, the effective material properties of skins are 
  obtained using the rule of mixture (ROM) and Halpin-Tsai (H-T) micromechanics models. 
  First, the governing equations of motion of a spinning viscoelastic sandwich beam are 
  obtained using the Hamilton principle. Then, the sandwich beam's natural frequencies are 
  calculated using the differential quadrature method (DQM). The effects of CNTs 
  distribution, nanotube volume fraction, spinning speed, critical loading, the thickness of 
  the core, axial force, and residual stress on the sandwich beam's natural frequency and 
  stability regions are investigated. According to the results of this study, based on the

  year = {2023},
  abstract = {In this study, forced vibration behavior of a piezo magneto electric sandwich 
  Timoshenko beam is investigated. It is assumed a sandwich beam with porous core and 
  graphene platelet reinforced composite (GPLRC) in facesheets subjected to 
  magneto-electro-elastic and temperature-dependent material properties. The magneto electro 
  platelets are under linear function along with the thickness that includes a cosine 
  function and magnetic and electric constant potentials. The governing equations of motion 
  are derived using modified strain gradient theory for microstructures. The effects of 
  material length scale parameters, temperature change, different distributions of porous, 
  various patterns of graphene platelets, and the core to face sheets thickness ratio on the 
  natural frequency and excited frequency of a sandwich Timoshenko beam are scrutinized. 
  Various size-dependent methods effects such as MSGT, MCST, and CT on the natural frequency 
  is considered. Moreover, the final results affirm that the increase in porosity coefficient 
  and volume fractions lead to an increase in the amount of natural frequency; while vice 
  versa for the increment in the aspect ratio. From forced vibration analysis, it is 
  understood that by increasing the values of volume fraction and the length thickness of 
  GPL, the maximum deflection of a sandwich beam decreases. Also, it is concluded that 
  increasing the temperature, the thickness of GPL, and the initial force leads to a decrease 
  in the maximum deflection of GPL. It is also shown that resonance phenomenon occurs when 
  the natural and excitation frequencies become equal to each other. Outcomes also reveal 
  that the third natural frequency owns the minimum value of both deflection and frequency 
  ratio and the first natural frequency has the maximum.},

  abstract = {In this study, based on Reddy cylindrical double-shell theory, the free 
  vibration and stability analyses of double-bonded micro composite sandwich cylindrical 
  shells reinforced by carbon nanotubes conveying fluid flow under magneto-thermo-mechanical 
  loadings using modified couple stress theory are investigated. It is assumed that the 
  cylindrical shells with foam core rested in an orthotropic elastic medium and the face 
  sheets are made of composites with temperature-dependent material properties. Also, the 
  Lorentz functions are applied to simulation of magnetic field in the thickness direction of 
  each face sheets. Then, the governing equations of motions are obtained using Hamilton's 
  principle. Moreover, the generalized differential quadrature method is used to discretize 
  the equations of motions and solve them. There are a good agreement between the obtained 
  results from this method and the previous studies. Numerical results are presented to 
  predict the effects of size-dependent length scale parameter, third order shear deformation 
  theory, magnetic intensity, length-to-radius and thickness ratios, Knudsen number, 
  orthotropic foundation, temperature changes and carbon nanotubes volume fraction on the 
  natural frequencies and critical flow velocity of cylindrical shells. Also, it is 
  demonstrated that the magnetic intensity, temperature changes and carbon nanotubes volume 
  fraction have important effects on the behavior of micro composite sandwich cylindrical 
  shells. So that, increasing the magnetic intensity, volume fraction and Winkler spring 
  constant lead to increase the dimensionless natural frequency and stability of micro 
  shells, while this parameter reduce by increasing the temperature changes. It is noted that 
  sandwich structures conveying fluid flow are used as sensors and actuators in smart devices 
  and aerospace industries. Moreover, carotid arteries play an important role to high blood 
  rate control that they have a similar structure with flow conveying cylindrical shells. In 
  fact, the present study can be provided a valuable background for more research and further

  nanocomposite plate are assumed to be graded in the direction of thickness and estimated 
  through the micro-mechanical approach. The governing equations are obtained using the 
  energy method. The natural frequencies and stresses of FG-SWBNNT-reinforced nanocomposite

  material length scale parameter, the functionally graded parameter, temperature changes and 
  elastic coefficients on the natural frequencies and stresses of the hollow circular 
  nanocomposite plate are investigated. The results of this research show that the natural 
  frequencies of the piezoelectric nanocomposite plate increase by increasing the material 
  length scale parameter, the elastic foundation parameters, the ratio of the inner radius to 
  the outer radius, the ratio of the thickness to the inner radius, and decreasing the power 
  index and temperature change. The radial stress of the nanocomposite plate varies 
  proportionally to its mode shape. The results can be employed to design smart structures in 
  micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS).},

  title = {Vibration analysis of rotating fully-bonded and delaminated sandwich beam with 
  CNTRC face sheets and AL-foam flexible core in thermal and moisture environments},
  author = {Mehdi Mohammadimehr Saeid Shahedi},
  year = {2020},
  abstract = {In the present study, the high-order free vibration analysis of rotating 
  fully-bonded and delaminated sandwich beams; with and without vertical contact; containing 
  AL-foam flexible core and carbon nanotubes reinforced composite (CNTRC) face sheets 
  subjected to thermal and moisture field are investigated by using generalized differential 
  quadrature method (GDQM). The compressible core and face sheets of sandwich beam, 
  respectively, are composed of Aluminum alloy foam with variable mechanical properties in 
  the thickness direction and CNTRC with temperature dependent material properties. In this 
  study, the high-order sandwich panel theory (HSAPT) for AL-foam flexible core and 
  Euler-Bernoulli beam theory for CNTRC face sheets are considered. By employing Hamilton’s 
  principle, the governing partial differential equations of motion and associated boundary 
  and continuity conditions for various types of regions (fully-bonded, delaminated with 
  contact, delaminated without contact) are derived and then discretized by using GDQM. The 
  final formulations lead to 14 partial differential equations for the entire structure 
  including five equations for fully-bonded two-headed parts of AL-foam cored sandwich beam 
  (AL-FCSB) and four equations for delaminated middle part of AL-FCSB beam which are combined 
  in axial and transverse deformations. A parametric study is performed to investigate the 
  influence of some important parameters such as existence of delaminated region, type of 
  delaminated region (with or without contact), longitudinal position of delaminated region, 
  slenderness ratio, face sheet thickness ratio, CNT volume fraction, temperature rise, 
  moisture concentration, rotating speed, and hub radius. The obtained results reveal that 
  the 1st frequency of delaminated AL-FCSB beam, whether with or without vertical contact, is 
  less remarkably than ones of fully-bonded AL-FCSB beam which its value for the case of 
  delaminated ‘with contact’ is larger than that of ‘without contact’. Moreover, the 1st 
  frequency variation of the delaminated AL-FCSB beam is symmetrical with regard to the 
  longitudinal position of the debonded region such that the 1st natural frequency declines 
  with moving the debonded region toward the center of the beam. The study of vibration 
  behavior of rotating sandwich beams is very important in design of rotating structural 
  systems, specially damaged ones, such as airplanes, helicopter rotor blades, and robot 
  arms. One of the most important types of damage encountered in mentioned cases is the 
  decomposition of two layers or delamination. Working these rotating structures in the 
  media, are always along with variations of temperature and humidity and hence their 
  mechanical properties may be changed due to the environment conditions.},

  abstract = {Compared with traditional tuned mass damper (TMD), non-traditional tuned mass 
  damper (NTMD) has higher damping efficiency in some conditions. Nevertheless, the 
  analytical optimization problem of NTMD has not been well solved; especially, multiple 
  optimal solutions are not discussed. In this study, the closed-form optimal expressions of 
  the NTMD using tuning stiffness are derived based on H2 norm optimization. And the 
  vibration mitigation performance of the NTMD is evaluated considering dual-solutions 
  situation subjected to typical ground motion and impulse excitation. Different from solving 
  the unique optimal frequency ratio, there exist two sets of optimal stiffness and damping 
  ratio derived using tuned spring elements for given mass ratio, and the effective mass 
  ratio is also limited as 1/3. The vibration mitigation or isolation performance and 
  robustness of H2 optimized NTMD with higher stiffness ratio are far superior to NTMD with 
  lower stiffness ratio. NTMD using larger optimal tuning stiffness ratio also can be seen as 
  an optimized form of Maxwell model using additional mass. Hence, using a large stiffness, 
  namely, a large frequency ratio to design NTMD is recommended, which is different from 
  traditional TMD. The case of NTMD with large stiffness can be adopted when the demands of 
  practical engineering are not met using the optimal parameters of small stiffness. And a 
  compromise scheme can also be provided, which are the combination with a larger mass ratio 
  but is less than the maximum limit value 1/3 and a not very large stiffness ratio but is 
  exceeded 0.5 according to demands of practical engineering.},

  that one obtains as large a band of exciting frequencies as possible within which the 
  vibration amplitude of the primary system is kept below unity. This choice is subject to 
  the condition that the fundamental of the primary system response have zero amplitude at a

  title = {Optimal probabilistic design of the dynamic performance of a vibration absorber},
  author = {Gordon J Savage Young Kap Son},
  year = {2007},
  abstract = {This paper presents a non-sample-based probabilistic approach to determine the 
  parameters in a vibration absorber when the main system is described by random variables. 
  The sinusoidal steady-state amplitude of the main mass is considered as the dynamic 
  performance measure. The design goal is to reduce both the mean and variance of the dynamic 
  performance measure over the excitation frequency range. The design process is complicated 
  because the resonance frequency of the main system is also a random variable. In order to 
  address these difficulties, system-specified, maximum, critical amplitudes according to 
  three critical frequencies capable of representing the excitation frequency range are 
  established. Then limit-state functions are formed at each of the critical frequencies by 
  subtracting the respective dynamic performance measure from the critical amplitude. Each 
  limit-state function establishes a non-conformance region in terms of the random variables. 
  The probability of the union of the non-conformance regions provides a single objective to

  structure. Similarly, a dynamic vibration absorber is proved to be a very simple and 
  effective vibration suppression device, with many practical implementations in civil and 
  mechanical engineering. This paper analyzes the prospect of using a vibration absorber for 
  possible energy harvesting. To achieve this goal, a vibration absorber is supplemented with 
  a piezoelectric stack for both vibration confinement and energy harvesting. It is assumed 
  that the original structure is sensitive to vibrations and that the absorber is the element 
  where the vibration energy is confined, which in turn is harvested by means of a 
  piezoelectric stack. The primary goal is to control the vibration of the host structure and 
  the secondary goal is to harvest energy out of the dynamic vibration absorber at the same 
  time. Approximate fixed-point theory is used to find a closed form expression for optimal 
  frequency ratio of the vibration absorber. The changes in the optimal parameters of the 
  vibration absorber due to the addition of the energy harvesting electrical circuit are 
  derived. It is shown that with a proper choice of harvester parameters a broadband energy 
  harvesting can be obtained combined with vibration reduction in the primary structure.},

  title = {Design of non-traditional dynamic vibration absorber for damped linear 
  structures},
  author = {Nguyen Xuan Nguyen ND Anh},
  year = {2014},
  abstract = {The Voigt-type of dynamic vibration absorber is a classical model and has 
  attracted considerable attention in many years because of its simple design, high 
  reliability and useful applications in the fields of civil and mechanical engineering. 
  Recently, a non-traditional type of dynamic vibration absorber was proposed. Unlike the 
  traditional damped absorber configuration, the non-traditional absorber has a linear 
  viscous damper connecting the absorber mass directly to the ground instead of the main 
  mass. There have been some studies on the design of the non-traditional dynamic vibration 
  absorber in the case of undamped primary structures. Those studies have shown that the 
  non-traditional dynamic vibration absorber has better performance than the traditional 
  dynamic vibration absorber. However, when damping is present at the primary system, there 
  are very few studies on the design of non-traditional dynamic vibration absorber. This 
  article presents a simple approach to determine the approximate analytical solutions for 
  the H∞ optimization of the non-traditional dynamic vibration absorber attached to the 
  damped primary structure subjected to force excitation. The main idea of the study is based 
  on the dual criterion suggested by Anh in order to replace approximately the original 
  damped structure by an equivalent undamped structure. Then the approximate analytical 
  solution of dynamic vibration absorber’s parameters is given by using known results for 
  undamped structure obtained. The comparisons have been done to verify the effectiveness of 
  the obtained results.},

  title = {Multi-degree of freedom passive and active vibration absorbers for the control of 
  structural vibration},
  author = {Anthony Frederick Harris},
  year = {2003},
  abstract = {This work investigates the use of multi-degree of freedom (MDOF) passive and 
  active vibration absorbers for the control of structural vibration as an improvement to 
  conventional single degree of freedom (SDOF) vibration absorbers. An analytical model is 
  first used to compare passive two degree of freedom (2DOF) absorbers to SDOF absorbers 
  using point impedance as the performance criterion. The results show that one 2DOF absorber 
  can provide the same impedance at two resonance frequencies as two SDOF absorbers for equal 
  amounts of total mass. Experimental testing on a composite cylindrical shell supports the 
  assertion that a 2DOF absorber can attenuate two resonance frequencies. Further modeling 
  shows that MDOF absorbers can utilize the multiple mode shapes that correspond to their 
  multiple resonance frequencies to couple into modes of a distributed primary system to 
  improve the attenuation of structural resonance. By choosing the coupling positions of the 
  MDOF absorber such that its mode shape mirrors that of the primary system, the mass of the 
  absorber can be utilized at multiple resonance frequencies. For limited ranges of targeted 
  resonance frequencies, this technique can result in MDOF absorbers providing attenuation 
  equivalent to SDOF absorbers while using less mass. The advantage gained with the MDOF 
  absorbers is dependent on the primary system. This work compares the advantage gained using 
  the MDOF absorbers for three primary systems: MDOF lumped parameter systems, a 
  pinned-pinned plate, and a cylindrical shell.},

  abstract = {To absorb the vibration of the car body of the high-speed train in multiple 
  degrees of freedom, a multi-degree of freedom dynamic vibration absorber (MDOF DVA) is 
  proposed. Installed under the car body, the natural frequency of the MDOF DVA from each DOF 
  can be designed as a DVA for every single degree of freedom of the car body. Hence, a 
  12-DOF model including the main vibration system and an MDOF DVA is established, and the 
  principle of Multi-DOF dynamic vibration absorption is analyzed by combining the design 
  method of a single DVA and genetic algorithm. Based on a high-speed train dynamics model 
  including an under-car-body MDOF DVA, the vibration control effect on each DOF of the MDOF 
  DVA is analyzed by the virtual excitation method. Moreover, a high static and low dynamic 
  stiffness (HSLDS) mount is proposed based on a cam–roller–spring mechanism for the 
  installation of the MDOF DVA due to the requirement of the low vertical dynamic stiffness. 
  From the dynamic simulation of a non-linear model in the time domain, the vibration control 
  performance of the MDOF DVA installed with a nonlinear HSLDS mount on the car body is 
  analyzed. The results show that the MDOF DVA can absorb the vibration of the car body in

  year = {2008},
  abstract = {In this study the dynamic analysis of the vehicle system modeled as a hybrid 
  discrete and continuous system has been investigated. The discrete system modeling has 
  formed the traditional ride dynamic analysis model for vehicle systems. In such a model the 
  chassis is assumed as a discrete block attached to different degrees of freedom that can 
  account for the unsprung masses, engine and driver among many others. However, this model 
  cannot accommodate all the aspects of a chassis which is strictly a continuous system. In 
  the present study the chassis is assumed as a flexible beam on which a pair of single 
  degree of freedom systems is added to account for the engine and driver. Moreover, the beam 
  is mounted on a couple of spring-damper elements that simulate the suspension of the 
  vehicle which results in a combination of continuous and discrete systems. In order to 
  solve this problem, the assumed mode method has been employed using the mode shapes of a 
  free-free beam. The method is applied on a city bus and the natural frequencies of the 
  undamped system were calculated. Further, the frequency responses for ground and engine 
  excitations were obtained. The method is validated by comparing the results with those 
  obtained by finite element method where the beam is meshed as a continuous system while all

  title = {An efficient approach for determining forced vibration response amplitudes of a 
  MDOF system with various attachments},
  author = {JH Chen JS Wu},
  year = {2012},
  abstract = {The frequency‐response curve is an important information for the structural 
  design, but the conventional time‐history method for obtaining the frequency‐response curve 
  of a multi‐degree‐of‐freedom (MDOF) system is time‐consuming. Thus, this paper presents an 
  efficient technique to determine the forced vibration response amplitudes of a multi‐span 
  beam carrying arbitrary concentrated elements. To this end, the "steady" response 
  amplitudes |Y(x)|s of the above‐mentioned MDOF system due to harmonic excitations (with the 
  specified frequencies we ) are determined by using the numerical assembly method (NAM). 
  Next, the corresponding "total" response amplitudes |Y(x)|t of the same vibrating system 
  are calculated by using a relationship between |Y(x)|t and |Y(x)|s obtained from the 
  single‐degree‐of‐freedom (SDOF) vibrating system. It is noted that, near resonance (i.e., 
  we/w≈ 1.0), the entire MDOF system (with natural frequency w) will vibrate synchronously in 
  a certain mode and can be modeled by a SDOF system. Finally, the conventional finite 
  element method (FEM) incorporated with the Newmark′s direct integration method is also used 
  to determine the "total" response amplitudes |Y(x)|t of the same forced vibrating system 
  from the time histories of dynamic responses at each specified exciting frequency we. It 
  has been found that the numerical results of the presented approach are in good agreement 
  with those of FEM, this confirms the reliability of the presented theory. Because the CPU 
  time required by the presented approach is less than 1% of that required by the 
  conventional FEM, the presented approach should be an efficient technique for the title 
  problem.},

  title = {Optimal parameters and characteristics of a three degree of freedom dynamic 
  vibration absorber},
  author = {Mariano Febbo},
  year = {2012},
  abstract = {The present study is devoted to the determination of the optimal parameters and 
  characteristics of a three degree of freedom dynamic vibration absorber (3 DOF DVA) for the 
  vibration reduction of a plate at a given point. The optimization scheme uses simulated 
  annealing and constrained simulated annealing, which is capable of optimizing systems with 
  a set of constraints. Comparisons between a 3 DOF DVA and multiple (5) 1 DOF DVAs show a 
  better performance of the former for vibration reduction. Regarding the characteristics of 
  the optimal 3 DOF DVA, numerical tests reveal that the absorber is robust under variations 
  of the observation point and for 10% variations of its mass, stiffness and damping. From 
  the analysis of parameter changes of the plate, it is found that the optimal 3 DOF DVA is 
  almost insensitive to a mass change, and sensitive to a change of Young’s modulus for low 
  frequencies. In this case, a decrease in Young’s modulus causes a decrease in its 
  effectiveness, and an increase improves it. The study of the effect of the 3 DOF DVA 
  location on its effectiveness reveals that the requirements of closeness of the absorber to 
  an antinode of the bare primary structure and to the observation point improve its 
  performance. Additionally, for a rotational mode of the 3-DOF DVA about some axis, the 
  effectiveness of the absorber at a given frequency can be notably increased if it is 
  located at a position of the primary system with an in-phase or out-of- phase motion of the 
  attachment points according to the rotational-mode characteristics of the 3-DOF DVA at this 
  frequency.},

  author = {Jaros{\l}aw Bednarz},
  year = {2013},
  abstract = {Based on analysis of the railroads, construction can be concluded that the wide 
  variety of design of the track rail vehicles is applicable in the country. The 
  constructions of railways tracks can be divided into two main groups: separate trackways 
  and built-in trackways. In the paper, a construction of vibroisolated trackway built-in or 
  located on engineering structure such as bridge or viaduct is presented. This proposed 
  construction of trackway consists of an embankment of land on which the bottom slab is 
  located. On the concrete bottom slab, the perforated rubber plates are stacked constituting 
  the elastic vibration isolation system. On the rubber platen, the concrete slab 
  constituting the so-called inertial mass is mounted. Then, on the platen, the sand bed and 
  the two layers of gravel with a variable grain size are placed. The final layer of crushed 
  stone reaches the level of railway ties to which the elastic rail pads are attached. The 
  several mathematical models of such vibration isolation systems of railway tracks were 
  proposed. One of these models allowing for an analysis that allows to formulate both 
  optimum conditions due to the selection and distribution of elastic-damping elements to 
  ensure the translational movement of the platen and the vehicle so the vibration isolation 
  system was “highly tuned”, ie the natural frequency of the system was higher than the 
  frequency of excitation caused by rail vehicles. It is a new trend in the design and 
  selection of vibration isolation systems of railway tracks. In the paper, the conception of 
  discrete-continuous vibration isolation system in which a continuous part is the beam 
  supported on discretely distributed elastic elements is presented. The load to the system 
  is modelling as solid body simulating the moving rail vehicle. The results of this analysis 
  are the main part of the proper selection of vibration isolation system of railway 
  tracks.},

  Optimization},
  author = {A Farshidianfar B Noori},

  abstract = {The solutions to H ∞ and H 2 optimization problems of a variant dynamic 
  vibration absorber (DVA) applied to suppress vibration in beam structures are derived 
  analytically. The H ∞ optimum parameters such as tuning frequency and damping ratios are 
  expressed based on fixed-point theory to minimize the resonant vibration amplitude, as well 
  as, the H 2 optimum parameters to minimize the total vibration energy or the mean square 
  motion of a beam under random force excitation as analytical formulas. The reduction in 
  maximum amplitude responses and mean square motion of a beam using the traditional 
  vibration absorber is compared with the proposed dynamic absorber. Numerical results show 
  the non-traditional DVA under optimum conditions has better vibration suppression 
  performance on beam structures than the traditional design of DVA. Furthermore, comparing H 
  ∞ and H 2 optimization procedures shows that for a beam under random force excitation, use 
  of H2 optimum parameters resulting in smaller mean square motion than the other 
  optimization.},

  title = {Acoustic multi-stopband metamaterial plates design for broadband elastic wave 
  absorption and vibration suppression},
  author = {P Frank Pai, Haoguang Deng Hao Peng},
  year = {2015},
  abstract = {This paper presents the modeling technique, working mechanism and design 
  guidelines for acoustic multi-stopband metamaterial plates for broadband elastic wave 
  absorption and vibration suppression. The metamaterial plate is designed by integrating 
  two-degree of freedom (DOF) mass–spring subsystems with an isotropic plate to act as 
  vibration absorbers. For an infinite metamaterial plate without damping, a working unit is 
  modeled using the extended Hamilton׳s principle, and two stopbands are observed through 
  dispersion analysis on the averaged three-DOF model. For a finite metamaterial plate with 
  boundary conditions and damping, shear-deformable conforming plate elements are used to 
  model the whole plate, and stopbands are investigated by frequency response analysis and 
  transient analysis. Influences of absorbers׳ resonant frequencies and damping ratios, plate׳s 
  boundary conditions and dimensions, and effective plate-absorber vibration modes are 
  thoroughly investigated. Results show that the metamaterial plate is essentially based on 
  the concept of conventional vibration absorbers. The local resonance of the two-DOF 
  subsystems generates two stopbands, and the inertial forces generated by the resonant 
  vibrations of absorbers straighten the plate and attenuate/stop wave propagation. Each 
  stopband׳s bandwidth can be increased by increasing the absorber mass and/or reducing the 
  average mass of isotropic plate in each working unit. Moreover, while a low damping ratio 
  for the primary absorber can guarantee absorbers׳ quick response to transient excitations, a 
  high damping ratio for the secondary absorber can combine the two stopbands into a wide 
  one. In the end, a sensitivity analysis on absorber resonant frequencies is conducted and 
  relatively large sensitivity is found at the two stopband regions.},

  abstract = {Conventionally, single-targeted H∞ or H2 optimization methods are adopted to 
  determine the optimal parameters of different Dynamic Vibration Absorbers (DVAs) 
  individually. A generic analytical framework for various DVAs considering a dual-target of 
  H∞ and H2 norms is lacking. Addressing these issues, a hybrid analytical H∞-H2 optimization 
  approach is proposed, leading to closed-form optimal solutions characterized by 
  equal-height fixed points and conditional minimum H2-norms, combining the advantages of H∞ 
  and H2 solutions. The proposed method is completely based on arbitrary filter coefficients 
  of the targeted transfer function. Therefore, it can be generically applied for various 
  DVAs. With the proposed method, the analytical optimal parameters of Negative-Stiffness 
  Inerter-based Tuned Mass Systems (NS-ITMSs) are obtained based on an extended generic 
  representation model considering multiple parameters. In extension, the method is 
  illustratively applied on three complicated DVAs, including a Lever-type Inerter-based 
  Vibration Absorber with Negative Stiffness (NS-LIVA) considering a leverage effect, a 
  Piezoelectric Shunt Damping System (PSDS) considering an electro-mechanical coupling 
  effect, and a Negative-Stiffness Tuned Viscous Mass Damper (NS-TVMD) for vibration isolator 
  considering a transmissibility target. The closed-form solutions for these advanced DVAs 
  are obtained for engineering reference. Furthermore, this method can be extended for more 
  complicated energy dissipation or harvesting techniques.},

  author = {Gaetan Kerschen Ghislain Raze},
  year = {2021},
  abstract = {Using a numerical searching technique the optimum parameters of multiple tuned 
  mass dampers (MTMD) for suppressing the dynamic response of a damped main system subjected 
  to external excitation are investigated. The criteria selected for the optimality is the 
  minimization of the steady-state displacement of the main system under external harmonic 
  excitation. The parameters of the MTMD that are optimized include: the damping ratio, the 
  tuning frequency ratio and the frequency band-width. The optimum parameters of the MTMD 
  system and corresponding steady-state displacement are obtained for different damping 
  ratios of the main system and the mass ratios of the MTMD system. The explicit formulae for 
  the optimum parameters of MTMD (i.e. damping ratio, band-width and tuning frequency) are 
  then derived using a curve-fitting scheme that can readily be used for engineering 
  applications. The error in the proposed explicit expressions is investigated and found to 
  be quite negligible. The effectiveness of optimally designed MTMD system is also compared 
  with that of the optimum single tuned mass damper and it is observed that the optimally 
  designed MTMD system is found to be more effective for vibration control than the single 
  tuned mass damper. Further, the damping in the main system significantly influences the 
  optimum parameters and the effectiveness of the MTMD system. Finally, a sensitivity 
  analysis of optimally designed MTMD system to study its performance under uncertainty in 
  the parameter is also carried out.},

  absorbers (DVAs): H∞ optimization, H2 optimization, and stability maximization. Recently, 
  interest has shifted to the optimization of multi-mass DVAs, but in fact, in even the most 
  basic single-mass DVA, the effect of primary system damping on the optimal solution is 
  still not fully understood with respect to the H∞ criterion. The author has recently 
  reported an exact H∞-optimal solution for a series-type double-mass DVA attached to a

  developed for a double-mass DVA to the optimization of a single-mass DVA. In the H∞ 
  optimization of the mobility transfer function, a highly accurate numerical solution was 
  successfully obtained by solving a single sixth-order algebraic equation. In the case of 
  the optimization of the compliance and accelerance transfer functions, it is shown that a 
  highly accurate numerical solution can be obtained by solving ternary systems of 
  simultaneous algebraic equations. It should be noted that the equations presented in this 
  paper can be factorized into simpler equations when there is no damping in the primary 
  system. It is also demonstrated herein that the factorized expressions yield the previously

  author = {Yoshito MIZUKAWA, Keisuke YAMADA Toshihiko ASAMI},
  year = {2020},
  abstract = {In the optimization of dynamic vibration absorbers (DVAs), it is generally 
  assumed that the damping force changes in proportion to the velocity of the object; this 
  damping is called viscous damping. However, many DVAs used in practical applications are 
  made of polymeric rubber materials having both restorative and damping effects. This 
  polymer material is considered to show a hysteretic damping force that is proportional to 
  the displacement rather than the velocity of the object. Despite the widespread use of such 
  hysteretically damped DVAs, there are very few studies on their optimal design, and the 
  design formula of the well-known general viscously damped DVA is presently used for the 
  design of this type of DVA. This article reports the optimal solution of this 
  hysteretically damped DVA. For generality, it is assumed that the primary system also has 
  structural damping that can be treated as hysteretic damping. Three optimization criteria, 
  namely the H∞ optimization, H2 optimization, and stability maximization criteria, were 
  adopted for the optimization of the DVA. For the H∞ optimization and stability maximization 
  criteria, exact algebraic solutions were successfully derived, and for the H2 criterion, 
  simultaneous equations with six unknowns and their numerical solutions were obtained.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the performance evaluation for a novel high-performance 
  nontraditional inerter-based dynamic vibration absorber called NIDVA-C4. For the easy 
  physical parameter tuning for the proposed device, the Extended Fixed-Points Technique 
  (EFPT) is applied, and then short closed-form solutions are provided for the undamped 
  systems. Subsequently, performance evaluation is carried out by computing two performance 
  measures, which are the H∞ and H 2 performance indices. For both H∞ and H 2 criteria, 
  constrained and unconstrained multivariable non-linear optimization problems are 
  formulated, which are solved through the formulation of sets of high-order nonlinear 
  equations. For H∞ optimization, the nondimensional FRF function of NIDVA-C4 is minimized at 
  resonant frequencies considering the harmonic force excitation case. For H 2 optimization, 
  two random vibration excitation cases are considered which are the following; random force 
  and ground motion excitation cases. For both random vibration excitation cases, the 
  variances of the squared modulus of the frequency response function are computed for 
  undamped primary structure. Considering the mass ratio range from 1% to 10%, from H∞ 
  performance evaluation, the numerical results revealed that the proposed device yields 
  improvements of 2–15% and 23–33% when compared to the inerter-based dynamic vibration 
  absorber (IDVA-C6) or rotational inertial double tuned mass dampers and classic DVA, 
  respectively. On the other hand, for the random force excitation case, improvements of 
  1–16% and 14–27% can be obtained. Furthermore, for the random acceleration excitation case, 
  the NIDVA-C4 provides dynamic performances of 2–6% and 15–20% compared with the IDVA-C6 and 
  classic dynamic vibration absorber (DVA), respectively. Finally, to appreciate the 
  vibration attenuation in the time domain, numerical simulations were carried out 
  considering the randomly excited mechanical systems.},

  title = {Closed-form solutions for the optimal design of lever-arm tuned mass damper 
  inerter (LTMDI)},
  author = {Ruisheng Ma, Kun Xu, Qiang Han Zhenchuan Li},
  year = {2024},
  abstract = {Tuned mass damper inerter (TMDI) has become a popular choice for vibration 
  control in flexible structures, including long-span bridges, due to its superior 
  performance compared to traditional tuned mass dampers (TMDs), such as improved control 
  effect and smaller static displacement. However, the control effect of TMDI is heavily 
  reliant on the spanning distance of inerter, which typically generates a significant 
  internal additional moment due to the force imbalance, limiting the practical application 
  of TMDI on flexible structures. For this reason, a novel lever-arm TMDI (LTMDI) is proposed 
  in this study, to suppress the vibrations of long-span bridges. The non-dimensional 
  governing equations of the bridge-LTMDI system are established in modal coordinates, and 
  the closed-form solutions of the optimum frequency and damping ratios of LTMDI are derived 
  based on the classical fixed-point theory. Parametric studies are conducted to investigate 
  the influences of the fulcrum position, modal shape ratio, mass ratio, inertance ratio and 
  asymmetric mode on the control effectiveness. Moreover, for comparison, the control 
  effectiveness of LTMDI is further compared to those of the TMD and TMDI. Finally, a 
  long-span bridge is selected as an example to demonstrate the effectiveness of LTMDI in 
  reducing vortex-induced vibration (VIV). The results show that the LTMDI has superior 
  control effect and space feasibility as compared to the TMD and TMDI in both frequency and 
  time domains. The derived analytical formulas can accurately determine the optimal 
  parameters, providing a simple yet efficient guideline for the application of LTMDI in 
  flexible structures.},

  genetic algorithm for surface roughness and tool wear in Ti6Al4V turning},
  author = {Minh Vuong Le, Hoang Dao Minh, Anh-Tu Nguyen Van-Hai Nguyen Tien-Thinh Le},
  year = {2023},
  abstract = {Titanium alloys are notoriously difficult to machine. They are used in the 
  manufacture of various types of lightweight components. It is therefore important to 
  improve their machinability and thus achieve sustainability in machining such alloys, by 
  selecting appropriate influential factors: cutting parameters, tool material, geometric 
  form, coolant types, and hybrid machining methods, to deliver efficient output. Nowadays, 
  meta-heuristic algorithms effectively solve multi-objective optimization in machining 
  problems instead of single-objective one. Along with that, the mathematical predictive 
  models used for single-objective optimization are gradually being replaced by machine 
  learning algorithms, which are highly robust and efficient in terms of prediction 
  performance. Therefore, this work addresses the prediction and optimization of average 
  surface roughness (Ra) and tool wear (VB) in Ti6Al4V alloy turning, using a WC tool coated 
  by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and physical vapor deposition (PVD), with dry machining. 
  We apply a two-pronged approach combining machine learning (ML) and Non-Dominated Sorting 
  Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II), to model and optimize Ra and VB. The four ML models – Linear 
  Regression (LIN), Support Vector Machine Regression (SVR), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), 
  and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) – are used to predict Ra and VB. The input variables of 
  the turning process – feed rate, depth of cut, cutting speed, cutting time, and tool 
  materials – are the major factors affecting surface quality and tool wear. By the error 
  metrics such as root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient 
  of determination (R2), ANN is found to offer the best predictive performance. An ML and 
  NSGA-II-based approach is then employed for multi-objective optimization of cutting 
  parameters in Ti6Al4V turning. Fifty Pareto solutions are identified in the range of Ra and 
  VB between (1.332 and 1.441 µm) and (0.100 and 0.125 mm), respectively. In this work, the 
  Pareto solutions are selected based on their ranked performances. This aligns with the 
  decision criterion employed to select the most robust cutting parameters. The definitive 
  optimal Ra and VB are obtained by formulating a robust decisive multi-criterion function 
  which integrates performance, preferred decision criterion, and trustworthiness. Finally, 
  this produces the optimal solution for Ra and VB − 1.439 µm and 0.100 mm, respectively. 
  Experimental validation confirms that the final optimum solution is within the acceptable 
  range.},

  abstract = {Random Vibration in Mechanical Systems focuses on the fundamental facts and 
  theories of random vibration in a form particularly applicable to mechanical engineers. The 
  book first offers information on the characterization and transmission of random vibration. 
  Discussions focus on the normal or Gaussian random process; excitation-response relations 
  for stationary random processes; response of a single-degree-of-freedom system to 
  stationary random excitation; wide-band and narrow-band random processes; and frequency 
  decomposition of stationary random processes. The text then examines failure due to random 
  vibration, including failure due to first excursion up to a certain level; fatigue failure 
  due to a stationary narrow-band random stress process; failure due to an accumulation of 
  damage; failure due to response remaining above a certain level for too great a fraction of 
  the time; and failure mechanisms. The manuscript is a vital reference for mechanical 
  engineers and researchers interested in random vibration in mechanical systems.

  abstract = {The use of dynamic vibration absorbers to control the vibration of a structure 
  in both narrow and broadbands is discussed in this paper. As a benchmark problem, a plate 
  incorporating multiple vibration absorbers is formulated, leading to an analytical solution 
  when the number of absorbers yields one. Using this analytical solution, control mechanisms 
  of the vibration absorber in different frequency bandwidths are studied; the coupling 
  properties due to the introduction of the absorber into the host structure are analyzed; 
  and the control performance of the absorber in different control bandwidths is examined 
  with respect to its damping and location. It is found that the interaction between the 
  plate and the absorber by means of the reaction force from the absorber plays a dominant 
  role in a narrow band control, while in a relatively broadband control the dissipation by 
  the absorber damping governs the control performance. When control bandwidth further 
  enlarges, the optimal locations of the absorbers are not only affected by the targeted 
  mode, but also by the other plate modes. These locations need to be determined after 
  establishing a trade-off between the targeted mode and other modes involved in the 
  coupling. Finally, numerical findings are assessed based on a simply-supported plate and a 
  fair agreement between the predicted and measured results is obtained.},

  year = {2013},
  abstract = {In this paper the averaging method is used to research the approximately 
  analytical solution of a semi-active on-off dynamic vibration absorber (DVA). At first the 
  approximately analytical solutions for the two existing semi-active on-off DVAs, named as 
  velocity-velocity based ground-hook control and displacement- velocity based ground-hook 
  control, are established by the averaging method. Then two other new semi-active on-off 
  DVAs, named as velocity-displacement based ground-hook control and 
  displacement-displacement based ground-hook control, are presented for the first time in 
  this paper and also researched analytically. Moreover, all the optimal parameters of the 
  four semi-active DVAs, including the stiffness and the maximum and minimum damping ratio of 
  the subsystem, are optimized to make the peak of the displacement transmissibility curve 
  minimum, based on the amplitude-frequency equations from approximately analytical 
  solutions. The comparisons of the displacement transmissibility obtained from the 
  approximate solutions and the numerical ones are fulfilled, and the results certify that 
  the approximate solutions have satisfactory precision. At last, the statistical results of 
  the stochastic responses of the primary systems, including the original single 
  degree-of-freedom system, the optimally passive DVA system, and the four semi-active on-off 
  DVA systems, are obtained when subject to random excitation. The results show that the two 
  new semi-active DVAs presented in this paper are almost as excellent as the existing two 
  semi-active DVAs, and all of the four semi-active DVAs have better control performance than 
  the optimally passive DVA.},

  structural system subject to a base acceleration. The non-dominated sorting genetic 
  algorithm in its second version (NSGA-II) is adopted to obtain the Pareto sets and the 
  corresponding optima for different characterizations of the system and input.

  vibrating systems},
  author = {Dario Richiedei, Alberto Trevisani Roberto Belotti},
  year = {2021},
  abstract = {The paper proposes a multi-domain approach to the optimization of the dynamic 
  response of an underactuated vibrating linear system through eigenstructure assignment, by 
  exploiting the concurrent design of the mechanical properties, the regulator and state 
  observers. The approach relies on handling simultaneously mechanical design and controller 
  synthesis in order to enlarge the set of the achievable performances. The underlying novel 
  idea is that structural properties of controlled mechanical systems should be designed 
  considering the presence of the controller through a concurrent approach: this can 
  considerably improve the optimization possibilities. The method is, first, developed 
  theoretically. Starting from the definition of the set of feasible system responses, 
  defined through the feasible mode shapes, an original formulation of the optimality 
  criterion is proposed to properly shape the allowable subspace through the optimal 
  modification of the design variables. A proper choice of the modifications of the elastic 
  and inertial parameters, indeed, changes the space of the allowable eigenvectors that can 
  be achieved through active control and allows obtaining the desired performances. The 
  problem is then solved through a rank-minimization with constraints on the design 
  variables: a convex optimization problem is formulated through the “semidefinite embedding 
  lemma” and the “trace heuristics”. Finally, experimental validation is provided through the 
  assignment of a mode shape and of the related eigenfrequency to a cantilever beam 
  controlled by a piezoelectric actuator, in order to obtain a region of the beam with 
  negligible oscillations and the other one with large oscillations. The results prove the 
  effectiveness of the proposed approach that outperforms active control and mechanical 
  design when used alone.},

  abstract = {Based on the principle of dynamic vibration absorption, a quasi-zero stiffness 
  (QZS) vibration isolation system for coupled a linear dynamic vibration absorber was 
  designed. The dynamic model of the coupled system is established, and the frequency domain 
  analytical solutions and the expression of force transmissibility are deduced by the 
  averaging method. The effects of mass, stiffness and damping of the vibration absorber on 
  the dynamic response and force transmissibility characteristics of the coupled system are 
  analyzed numerically, and compared with an equivalent QZS vibration isolation system. The 
  results reveal that the amplitude curve of the primary system shifts to the low-frequency 
  range with the increase of mass ratio, the valley value appears and lower to  when the 
  excitation frequency equals to the natural frequency of the absorber. Increase stiffness 
  ratio can reduce the valley amplitude and the second peak amplitude of the primary system. 
  The large the damping of the absorber, the lower the valley amplitude of the primary system 
  can be acquired. As the mass ratio increases from 0.2 to 1, the initial isolation frequency 
  of the coupled system decreases by 23.2%, which enlarges the bandwidth of the effective 
  isolation frequency range. Large stiffness ratio or larger damping ratio of the absorber 
  can improve the isolation performance in the frequency range near the second peak 
  amplitude. Compared with the equivalent QZS isolation system, the coupled system possesses 
  more excellent performance in the frequency domain near the valley amplitude and wider

  abstract = {This paper examines multiple tuned mass dampers (TMD's) with natural 
  frequencies distributed over a frequency range. An integral form for the impedance is 
  developed by asymptotic techniques. The result is used to analyze the vibration control 
  capabilities of multiple TMD's for structures subjected to wide-band input. Calculus of 
  variations is used to optimize the design of the TMD's with a constraint on the total mass. 
  It is found that multiple TMD's can be more effective and more robust than a single TMD 
  with equal total mass.

The first part of this paper extends these results to multiple TMD’s with arbitrary 
properties. The analysis is based on concepts from Crandall’s [11, 12] and Dowell and 
Kubota’s [13] asymptotic theories and Skudrzyk’s mean value theory [14, 15]. The only 
assumptions are that the natural frequencies of the TMD’s are closely spaced and that the 
masses and damping ratios of the TMD’s vary slowly with respect to their natural frequencies. 
The final asymptotic result for the main oscillator response is in terms of a simple 
integral.
The second part of this paper addresses the optimal design problem. The goal is to determine 
the properties of the multiple TMD’s which minimize the response of the main oscillator. The 
constraint is given by an upper bound for the total mass of the TMD’s. The approach used 
herein is based on the Euler–Lagrange equations from the calculus of variations [16]. This is 
a natural approach for the problem because of the integral form for the response. A closed 
form analytical solution is derived for the optimal design parameters.
In the optimal design, the multiple TMD’s are not all exactly tuned to the main oscillator. 
This implies that multiple TMD’s are more effective in vibration reduction than a single TMD 
with equal mass. An example illustrates this conclusion; moreover, it shows that multiple 
TMD’s have robust properties under mistuned conditions: their performance degrades less than 
that of single TMD’s when the natural frequency of the main oscillator is not equal to the 
value used in design.},

The numerical results show that the tuned-mass damper is less effective in reducing the

  various vibration absorbers of linear and nonlinear coupling dynamics have been widely 
  studied in plenty of publications where some have been applied in real-world practical 
  applications. Firstly, the tuned-mass-damper (TMD), the first well-known linear vibration 
  absorber that has been well-studied in the literature and applied with various structural 
  and dynamical systems, is discussed. The linear vibration absorbers such as TMDs are widely 
  used in real-life small- and large-scale structures due to their robust performance in 
  vibration suppression of the low natural frequency structural modes. However, the TMD 
  performs efficiently at narrowband frequency range where its performance is deteriorated by 
  any changes in the frequency content in the structure and the TMD itself. Therefore, the 
  targeted-energy-transfer mechanism which is found to be achieved by nonlinear energy sinks 
  (NESs) has ignited the interest in passive nonlinear vibration suppression. Unlike TMDs, 
  the NESs are dynamical vibration absorbers that achieve vibration suppression for wide 
  range of frequency-energy levels. Given the very rapid growth in this field and the 
  extensive research studies supporting the robustness of the NESs, this paper presents the 
  different types of NESs and their applications with main emphasis on the rotary-based and

  wind-wave misalignment and vortex induced vibrations. However, most of existing research 
  focus on unidirectional vibration attenuation which is inadequate for real applications. 
  The present paper proposes a three dimensional pendulum tuned mass damper (3d-PTMD) to 
  mitigate the tower and nacelle dynamic response in the fore-aft and side-side directions. 
  An analytical model of the wind turbine coupled with the 3d-PTMD is established wherein the 
  interaction between the blades, the tower and the 3d-PTMD is modeled. Aerodynamic loading 
  is computed using the Blade Element Momentum method where the Prandtls tip loss factor and 
  the Glauert correction are considered. JONSWAP spectrum is adopted to generate wave data. 
  Wave loading is computed using Morisons equation in collaboration with the strip theory. 
  Via a numerical search approach, the design formula of the 3d-PTMD is obtained and examined 
  on a National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) monopile 5 MW baseline wind turbine model under 
  misaligned wind, wave and seismic loading. Dual linear tuned mass dampers (TMDs) deployed 
  in the fore-aft and side-side directions are utilized for comparison. It is found that the 
  3d-PTMD with a mass ratio of 2% can improve the mitigation of the root mean square and peak 
  response by around 10% when compared with the dual linear TMDs in controlling the 
  bi-directional vibration of the offshore wind turbines under misaligned wind, wave and

similitude problems., The wave height and the base shear force in the TLDs were measured. A 
virtual mass and a virtual damping for a TLD attached to an undamped linear SDOF structure 
were calculated from the experimental results and then amplitude-dependent equivalent mass, 
frequency and damping were obtained using the TMD analogy. Finally, some important TLD 
properties are discussed on the basis of these results.},

Abstract
This paper investigates the nonlinear behavior of tuned liquid dampers (TLDs) and its effects 
on the vibration control effectiveness of the damper. A nonlinear reduced-order model (ROM) 
is developed and validated by full-scale experiments, and is used for performing extensive 
time-domain simulations of both a pure TLD and a structure-TLD system under different 
excitation conditions. Different nonlinear behaviors of the liquid inside the TLD are 
predicted by the model, including higher-order harmonic responses, amplitude-dependent 
responses, jump phenomenon, irregular-shaped hysteretic loops and chaotic motions. It is 
observed that a shallow-water TLD exhibits hardening spring effect while a deep-water TLD 
exhibits softening spring effect. In general, a tuned TMD outperforms a tuned TLD, and the 
performance of the tuned TLD in reducing structural responses is deteriorated with increasing 
excitation amplitude. However, when both dampers are detuned (tuning ratio larger than the 
classic value), the shallow-water TLD can outperform the TMD as the excitation amplitude 
increases due to the hardening effect. This observation has been confirmed from both harmonic 
excitation and stochastic excitation. On the other hand, a deep-water TLD has the advantage 
that its performance is less amplitude-dependent and thus more robust.},

  abstract = {Tuned liquid dampers (TLDs) are economical dynamic vibration absorbers which 
  are increasingly being used for structural response control. Nevertheless, a thorough 
  understanding of the sloshing behavior inside the TLD is essential for efficient design. In 
  this paper, a truly incompressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics (ISPH) method is 
  employed to circumvent the difficulties regarding the simulation of fully nonlinear 
  sloshing motion induced by large amplitude excitations. The behavior of the TLD with 
  damping screens is studied numerically over a wide range of excitation frequencies and 
  amplitudes. It is found through comparison with the existing experimental data that the 
  ISPH model is a powerful tool for accurate predictions of the TLD behavior. The 
  amplitude-dependent properties of an equivalent tuned mass damper (TMD) model, which is 
  capable of reproducing the energy dissipation characteristics of the TLD, are derived from 
  the simulations results. Good agreement between the numerical and experimental results is 
  indicative of the equivalent model’s ability to predict the response of structure–TLD 
  systems, suggesting that the ISPH model can properly simulate the TLD behavior. The effect 
  of screen placement on the performance of structure–TLD systems is also investigated. 
  Findings reveal that improved performance of TLD can be realized under high amplitude 
  excitations by placing the damping screens in the locations corresponding to the higher 
  sloshing modes.},

  abstract = {A fully nonlinear 2-D s-transformed finite difference solver has been developed 
  based on inviscid flow equations in rectangular tanks. The fluid equations are coupled to a 
  linear elastic support structure. Nonoverturning sloshing motions are simulated during 
  structural vibration cycles at and outside resonance. The wave tank acts as a tuned liquid 
  damper (TLD). The TLD response is highly nonlinear when large liquid sloshing occurs. The 
  solver is valid at any water depth except for small depth when shallow water waves and 
  viscous effects would become important. Results of liquid sloshing induced by horizontal 
  base excitations are presented for small to steep nonbreaking waves at tank aspect ratios, 
  depth to length, h/b of 0.5, 0.25 and 0.125, representing deep to near shallow water cases. 
  The effectiveness of the TLD is discussed through predictions of coupling frequencies and 
  response of the tank-structural system for different tank sizes and mass ratios between 
  fluid and structure. An effective tank-structural system typically displays two distinct 
  frequencies with reduced structural response (e.g., h=b ¼ 0:5). These eigenfrequencies 
  differ considerably from their noninteracting values. Hardening or softening spring 
  behavior of the fluid, known to be present in solutions of pure sloshing motion in tanks, 
  does not exists in the coupled system response. Strongest interactions occur with only one 
  dominating sloshing mode when the nth sloshing frequency is close to the natural frequency 
  of the structure, as the mass ratio between fluid and structure m ! 0: Inclusion of higher 
  modes reduces the efficiency of the TLD. Good agreement is achieved between the numerical 
  model and a first-order potential theory approximation outside the resonance region when 
  the unsteady sloshing motions remain small. When the free-surface amplitudes become large 
  in the coupled system, the numerical peaks are larger and the troughs become lower as time 
  evolves (typical nonlinear effects) compared to the linear solution. Nonlinearities were 
  found to reduce the system displacement significantly, e.g., system resonance shifted to 
  beating response, compared to linear predictions. It was also found that the system 
  response is extremely sensitive to small changes in forcing frequency. In conclusion, if 
  strong interaction exists, the coupled system exhibits nonlinearity in structural and 
  free-surface response, but the coupled eigenfrequencies compare well with the linear 
  predictions. Furthermore, the solver removes the need for free-surface smoothing for the 
  cases considered herein (maximum wave steepness of 1.2). The numerical model provides a 
  quick and accurate way of determining system eigenfrequencies which can be hard to identify 
  and interpret in physical experiments.},

  abstract = {Tuned mass damper (TMD) is a seismic vibration control device used to reduce 
  wind and seismic vibrations of structures. Although TMD is attractive to many researchers 
  due to its simplicity, optimizing its parameters and positions is very challenging. The 
  sensitivity of TMD to structure's frequency changes is among its weaknesses and if 
  parameters of this system are not optimally tuned, the efficiency of this system decreases. 
  To solve this problem, multiple tuned mass dampers (MTMDs) have been proposed. In this 
  research, in order to study and compare single tuned mass damper (STMD) with MTMDs 
  vertically distributed according to modal analysis, a 20-story building is used. The 
  structure is analyzed in OpenSees under seven ground motions with a peak ground 
  acceleration (PGA) of 1.0 g. To optimize TMD parameters, particle swarm optimization (PSO) 
  algorithm is used and the results are compared to those obtained from Den Hartog's 
  approach. To be able to use PSO algorithm and optimize TMD design parameters, Matlab and 
  OpenSees are linked together. In this paper, more than one vibration mode is used to tune 
  and distribute dampers to overcome higher mode effects in high-rise buildings. The results 
  showed that depending on their different layouts and different optimization methods used, 
  MTMDs reduce the average maximum responses of the structure by up to 12.1%. This is while 
  STMD is able to reduce maximum responses of the structure by 4.3%.},

  abstract = {The mechanical behavior of classical materials can be described by their elastic constant, which relates stress to strain. In advanced engineering materials that are often referred to as smart or intelligent materials, the mechanical behavior is also influenced by other fields; such as magnetic, electric charge, temperature, light and chemical composition. This is also reflected in the underlying constitutive equations, which couple two or more of these fields to describe the physical behavior of the material. These aforementioned materials have desirable properties when it comes to their use in active vibration control (AVC), since they may be readily integrated within the controlled structure and do not alter the mass of the mechanical system significantly. The aim of this chapter is thus to give a review of advanced engineering materials used in active and semi-active vibration control. The chapter covers the shape memory and superelastic property of shape memory alloys (SMA) and their current use in vibration control. Magnetostrictive and electrostrictive (MS, ES) materials are less commonly utilized in vibration control, however due to their engineering potential we will give a concise account of these materials and the underlying physical principles. The advantages of magnetorheological (MR) fluid based dampers with adjustable properties have become increasingly recognized in the engineering community, thus the discussion of magnetorheological and the related electrorheological (ER) fluids is provided here as well. Piezoelectric materials such as piezoceramics are probably the most commonly used smart materials in AVC. Here, we introduce the direct and converse piezoelectric effect, a short review on the application of transducers in vibration damping and some notes on the mathematical modeling of their dynamics. The chapter is finished by the emerging electrochemical materials or electroactive polymers (EAP).},

In the literature, a combination of two or more vibration-control mechanisms, such as passive, active, and semiactive schemes, are defined as a hybrid vibration-control system. This review focused on seismic and wind response mitigation of structures using hybrid vibration-control devices. It started with the historical background of vibration-control systems and categorized hybrid control schemes within a proper frame of references. A detailed literature review on theoretical studies, experimental investigations, and real-life applications of hybrid vibration-control systems was presented. Specifically, this review presented the development in hybrid vibration-control schemes such as passive-passive, semiactive-passive, and active-passive systems. Active-passive damping devices combine the reliability, robustness, and low cost of viscoelastic damping with high-performance, model-selective, and adaptive piezoelectric active control. The semiactive-passive system is a combined system of semiactive damping devices and passive dampers. The passive-passive system consists of two or more passive damping devices. The review shed light on the pros and cons of each of hybrid vibration-control systems and provided the scope of future research for more robust vibration control, which involves dealing with limitations such as weight, size, cost, maintenance, and design obstacles of hybrid vibration-control systems.},
